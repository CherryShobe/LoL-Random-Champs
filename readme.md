# What is this?
Small things I made for my and my friends when we play League and go all fill in a 5 stack. Gives each player a random champ for each lane while making sure there's no duplicates.

In `lolchamps.txt` the `+` character is used when there should be a space in their name, like `Lee+Sin` for it to actually print `Lee Sin`.
